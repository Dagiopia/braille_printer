Print Visualizer

The code here is written in Python.
It is the visualizer of the braille cells to be printed and
is the window shown when the 'Preview' button is clicked on
the application's GUI.
It is only suppose to show where the dots will be punched on
the paper before actually commanding the printer to print.
