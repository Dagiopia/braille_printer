Braille Printer Micro-controller Code

The code here is written for an Arduino Mega board.
The exact version of the board doesn't matter. The only
influence in choosing the Arduino Mega is that it has 4KB
EEPROM. The cheaper Arduino boards have less capacity.
Although this was the plan, the current code can work with
any popular Arduino board as the data sent from the computer
is stored in RAM and not in the EEPROM.
