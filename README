This is the collection of files on a project to build a CNC like machine to be used for 
braille printing/embossing.

This directory contains three subdirectories: 
	Electrical Design - This folder contains everything to do with the electrical
			    design of the device. It contains Proteus simulation project
			    and code for the micro-controller. 
	Mechanical Design - This folder contains the mechanical design of the device.
			    The design was done using the Solidworks software. 
			    All parts and their assembly is included in there.
	
	Software	  - This folder contains the code for the desktop application
			    that is used to command the printer and a few other trial
			    and experimentation codes for visualizing braille cells and
			    such.
